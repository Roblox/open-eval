		There may be an issue when this evaluation is ran in the test environment.
		A 'perfect' implementation of this query would require the music to only be ran
		on the game client, not server.

		So the immediate solution then feels like a RemoteFunction would be necessary.
		However this creates a catch-22, since our end we execute code via a plugin
		already running in Client context.
